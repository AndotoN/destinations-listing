- React: JavaScript library used for building user interfaces and handling state management.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for designing responsive and modern layouts.

How It Works

Users can select places from a pre-populated list of famous destinations. Once selected, these destinations are added to a personal list of places the user wants to visit.
